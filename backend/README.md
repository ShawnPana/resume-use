> ### september 30, 2025
> - be warned, we reagan and I were in a rush to get this out, so the app is probably a bit buggy. the main struggles are connecting the frontend to the backend and making sure that the database schemas are correct.
> - this one isn't too mocked! just make sure to create a `.env.local` file in the root directory following `.env.example`. 
> - right now, we only have linkedin and simplify well integrated, but we plan on adding more services soon.
